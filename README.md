## Rules

- Use short, concise sentences. Like this one.
- Put **important** informations first, in **descending order** of importance.
- Gather information that has things in common.
- Use subs-titles when there is too much information in a row.
- **Bold** key ideas and important **concepts** for even faster reading, and to make **checkpoints** in the text.
- Prefer to turn off the **ambiguities** of a sentence explicitly rather than using **hard-to-interpret** specific **vocabulary**.
(unless it is well-known vocabulary by the target community, or if it's defined previously)
- Use **examples** so the reader can see and compare **behaviors** without lot of explanations.
- Use **step by step** explanations to describe a process.

## Examples

> In C++, an array is an address pointing to a contiguous memory space, split into N spaces for each element of size T bytes.

Short, slow.

> In C++, an array is a list of elements.
> 
> It size could not change.
> 
> All of its elements have the same size in byte.
> 
> Its elements are next to each other in memory.
> 
> It is just a pointer.

Long, fast.
