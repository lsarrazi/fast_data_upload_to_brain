#Â Reading

## Language

- Use short, concise sentences. Like this one.
- **Bold** key ideas and important **concepts** for even faster reading, and to make **checkpoints** in the text.
- Prefer to turn off the **ambiguities** of a sentence explicitly rather than using **hard-to-interpret** specific **vocabulary**
(unless it is well-known vocabulary by the target community, or if you have defined the term previously)
Example:

> In C++, an array is an address pointing to a contiguous memory space, split into N spaces for each element of size T bytes.

Short, slow.

> In C++, an array is a list of elements.
> 
> It size could not change.
> 
> All elements have the same size in byte.
> 
> Elements are next to each other in memory.
> 
> It is just a pointer

Long, fast.
